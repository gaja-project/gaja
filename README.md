## 📝 Overview
Gaja was created by a team of language learners who wanted the ability to enhance the overall language learning experience. Through [Co.lab](https://www.joincolab.io), they created and [pitched](https://pitch.com/v/gaja-fx3hh6) a product that could not only help them, but others as well!

Gaja is a Chrome extension that enables two different language subtitles to be displayed at the same time. What this means is that you can have one subtitle be your native language, and the second be language you are trying to learn!
