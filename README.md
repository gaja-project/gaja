## üìù Overview
Gaja was created by a team of language learners who wanted the ability to enhance the overall language learning experience. Through [Co.lab](https://www.joincolab.io), they created and [pitched](https://pitch.com/v/gaja-48ymb2) a product that could not only help them, but others as well!

Gaja is a Chrome extension that enables two different language subtitles to be displayed at the same time. What this means is that you can have one subtitle be your native language, and the second be language you are trying to learn!

## üî® Development

Gaja's uses Html, CSS, and Javascript to get the job done üí™.

***
The popup contents can be found in the `popup.htlm` file. Here we create a form for user interaction.
```html
    <form id="popup-form" class="container"> 
```
This form holds the buttons and toggles for user interaction. Currently this form only houses a on / off switch and the size selection radio buttons.
***
The CSS to the popup window can be found in the `popup.css` file. This file is meant to only style the popup. This file does not do any subtitle modifications.
***
The script for the functionality of the popup window can be found in `background.js`. In here we add event listeners such as this
```js script
    chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener()
```
to check for any user input on the form and set the default variables for `content.js` to use. We can set then set these variables using: 
```js script
    chrome.storage.sync.set()
```
which sets variable into chrome local storage. These vairables will then speak with our `content.js`.
***

Our `content.js` holds our meat and potatoes. In here we have our dual subtitle and font sizing functionality. 
To start, our file holds a listener to check any user changes which should have been toggled by `background.js`. Once a user activates the dual subtitles, our first mission is to create a new container for these subtitles in our
```js script
    // Creates a subtitle container
    function createNewSubContainer(){

        // Get Netflix's container returns it for refrence
        const timedtext = getNetflixContainer()

        // Style our subtitle container in a new function
        stylingContainer(divy, mySubs, timedtext);

        const callback = function (mutationsList, observer){
            // Observer information
        }

        // Our observer that uses the callback to run
        window.observer = new MutationObserver(callback);
        window.observer.observe(timedtext, window.config);
    }
```
We also need netflix's container for reference which we get using 
```js script
    function getNetflixContainer(){
        const netflixEl = "player-timedtext";
        const timedtext = document.getElementsByClassName(netflixEl)[0];

        // Set translate to no, that way both subtitles container don't translate to english
        timedtext.setAttribute('translate', 'no');
        return timedtext
    }
```
Setting the container attribute to no is important because it allows one subtitle container to remain the same while the other translates. Which leads us to the other function we call in our `createNewSubContainer()` function which is the `stylingContainer()` function. In here we style our new container using the netflix container as reference and we also style our p tag which exists in our new container.
```js script
    // Function to style our container, recieves our new div container, our p tag, and the netflix sub container
    function stylingContainer(newDiv, pTag, netflixTimedtext){
        // Set our subtitle container to be able to use right click translate feature by allowing it translate
        newDiv.setAttribute('translate', 'yes');
        
        // Style code in here
    }
```
Lastly in our `createNewSubContainer()` function we have our callback function that allows us to manage our container to any updates it observers from netflix's subtitle container.
